the_year_motto: ANTHROPOGENIC AND NATURAL SOIL LANDSCAPES IN EUROPEAN RUSSIA&#58;FROM
  SEA TO SEA
motto_addition: Monitoring, modeling and managing urban soils and green infrastructure
school_dates: July 6 â€“ 26, 2020, Registration is opened
intro_general: "<p>The 3MUGIS summer school is an annual event, which addresses relevant contemporary environmental consequences and opportunities of urbanization with special emphasis on soil functions. The event is organized under the umbrella of the International Union of Soil Science (IUSS), RUDN University (Russia) and the Urban Soil Institute (USA) with strong cooperation from universities, institutions and research teams from around the world.</p>
<p>The 3MUGIS summer school provides students with first hand field experience examining anthropogenic impact sequences across conventional soil forming factors from Sub-artic to Dry steppe climates. At the end of the program, students will better understand the social, climactic, and geographic factors that contribute to human soil modification in this region; the long-term implications of such changes; practical skills to perform in-field soil monitoring, soil mapping and remote sensing; and applied skills in identifying, implementing, and managing opportunities for urban green infrastructure development.</p>"

big_intro: "<p>Building from considerable experience and feedback from participants
  during the first two years, the organizers have decided to further focus the school
  on solid practical skills in monitoring, modeling and mapping urban soils and green
  infrastructure over different climatic and anthropogenic conditions. Lessons from
  traditional, long-standing and internationally recognized zonal soil geography field
  courses from Moscow State University (Russia) and the University of California (USA)
  are being incorporated to provide additional structure, congruence, and rigor to
  the 3MUGIS program. The organizers intend for the school to become a globally recognized
  training program that provides students with first hand field experience examining
  anthropogenic impact sequences across conventional soil forming factors from Sub-artic
  to Dry steppe climates. At the end of the program, students will better understand
  the social, climactic, and geographic factors that contribute to human soil modification
  in this region; the long-term implications of such changes; practical skills to
  perform in-field soil monitoring, soil mapping and remote sensing; and applied skills
  in identifying, implementing, and managing opportunities for urban green infrastructure
  development.</p><p>Five days of focused on-campus training in skills relevant to
  the sites visited will occur at RUDN University in Moscow city. They will be followed
  by an expanded two-week field tour from the White Sea (Kandalaksha town, 67N; 32E)
  to the Azov Sea (Taganrog town, 47N; 38E). The tour will give students a unique
  overview of the natural and cultural diversity of European Russia. Five zones (subarctic,
  taiga, deciduous forest, forest-steppes and steppes) will be studied in regard to
  key issues of urban development, including industrial pollution, forest management,
  agricultural development, and urban-rural interactions. Urban soils and green infrastructure
  at each of the region will be studied in comparison to natural references. Conventional
  field descriptions and classification will be amplified by advanced techniques of
  in-field analysis. Lecture and field parts will consistently follow the problem-oriented
  framework to be presented at the final team and individual projects, and a short
  quiz will occur after each field tour stop that covers topics most relevant to that
  stop. </p>"
history: For the first time, the school was organized in Moscow ahead of the SUITMA
  9 international congress in May 2017 and attracted students and young researchers
  from 8 countries. Five days included lectures, seminars, lab and field practicals,
  art and design master classes and a rich social program. Top-level experts with
  different backgrounds including environmental protection, civil engineering and
  policy-making shared their skills and knowledge. The key-note speeches were given
  by the IUSS president Prof. Rattan Lal (USA), IUSS elected president Takashi Kasaki
  (Japan), Noble Prize Laureate Prof. Riccardo Valentini (Italy), SUITMA president
  Prof. J. Kim (South Korea), Prof. J.L. Morel (France), Prof. W. Burghardt (Germany),
  Prof. M. Gerasimova (Russia) and Prof. Z. Cheng (USA). In 2018, 3MUGIS included
  two parts&#58; an intensive week of lectures, followed by a week long field tour
  observing natural and anthropogenic soils and landscapes from the taiga to the steppes
  of Russia.
