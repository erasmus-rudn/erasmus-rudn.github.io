                    <p>The 3MUGIS summer school is an annual event, which addresses current environmental consequences and opportunities of urbanization with special emphasis on 
                        soil functions. The event is organized under the umbrella of the International Union of Soil Science (IUSS), RUDN University (Russia) and the Urban Soil 
                        Institute (USA) with strong cooperation from universities, institutions and research teams from around the world.</p>
                    <p>The 3MUGIS-2021 will be held online. The program includes lectures and seminars by the top-level scientists and practitioners, lifehacks on Scientific 
                        writing skills as well as life broadcasts and live action videos from the 3MUGIS-2022 field tour sites.</p>
                    <p> At the end of the program, students will better understand ecology and biogeochemistry of urban soils and plants, advances in monitoring and modeling of 
                        urban soils and green infrastructures, role of nature-based solutions and urban green infrastructure for human health and well-being.</p>

                    <p>The 3MUGIS summer school provides students with first hand field experience examining anthropogenic impact sequences across conventional soil forming factors from Sub-artic to
Dry steppe climates. At the end of the program, students will better understand the social, climactic, and geographic factors that contribute to human soil modification in this region;
the long-term implications of such changes; practical skills to perform in-field soil monitoring, soil mapping and remote sensing; and applied skills in identifying, implementing, and managing opportunities for urban green infrastructure development.</p>-->
