description: 3MUGIS will take place in Russia July 6 â€“ July 26 2020 and will include two parts. Five days of focused on-campus training in skills relevant to the sites visited will occur at RUDN University in Moscow city. They will be followed by an expanded two-week field tour from the Barents Sea (Terriberka village, 69N; 35E) to the Black Sea (Abrau Durso, 44N; 37E). Six zones (subarctic, taiga, deciduous forest, forest-steppes, steppes and subtropics) will be studied in regard to key issues of urban development, including industrial pollution, forest management, agricultural development, and urban-rural interactions. Urban soils and green infrastructure at each of the region will be studied in comparison to natural references.
